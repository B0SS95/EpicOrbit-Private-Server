EpicOrbit Private Server

Some of you might know me some not, doesn't really matter. To introduce myself quick, I used to be the co-developer of EpicOrbit back in the days. As I recently saw that someone else already have the files, I'm willing to share it with you all. I won't help anyone of you guys if you don't know what to do with this files don't touch it, as we already have one who pretends to be a developer because he managed to change some values in the source code. Congrats on that haha

All you need is simply Visual Studio and mongodb compass (for the database) thats it, no xampp or anything else. Once you start the Emulator it will automatically create all the necessary tables within your database. Since EpicOrbit have its Client and Webserver all in one. Just open up the project in Visual Studio and watch yourself. Take care and have fun with it. 
I'm out, Peace
